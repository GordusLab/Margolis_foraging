The following files were used for the Margolis & Gordus manuscript:

N2_cumevents_matrix.mat: This matlab file was provided by Alejandro Lopez-Cruz, and is the quantification of reorientation events from the Lopez-Cruz et al paper. The elements of N2_cumevents_matrix are the cumulative reorientions observed for 1631 worms. Rows = frames (3fps, 8100 frames= 45 min), Columns = Individuals.

Model_2024.m: This code uses the Gillespie algorithm to model the experimental data from N2_cumevents_matrix.
